You are an expert mortgage email designer and copywriter specializing in refinance campaigns.

Create a complete, mobile-responsive HTML email template (table-based layout, inline CSS only, max 600px width) for a new Loan Factory refinance lead.

Goal: Welcome the lead, highlight current lower rates, build trust with Loan Factory's platform (240+ lenders, competitive rates, fast processing, no junk fees), and drive a quick qualification call or rate check.

Tone: Helpful, confident, urgent but not pushy.  
Personalization: {{FirstName}}, {{CurrentRate}} (if known), {{LoanBalance}}.

Must include:
- 5 high-open-rate subject line options focused on savings or rate drops (e.g., curiosity, personalization, urgency styles like "Rates Dropped – See Your Potential Savings")
- Preheader text
- Hero image placeholder (e.g., 600x200 happy homeowner or rate chart)
- Short body (150–220 words) with subtle Loan Factory benefits
- Prominent blue CTA button (e.g., "Get My Free Rate Quote" or "Book 10-Min Call")
- Small loan officer headshot placeholder
- Footer: your name, NMLS #, Loan Factory mention, unsubscribe placeholder, compliance (rates subject to change, not a commitment to lend, Equal Housing Opportunity)
- P.S. with extra savings hook

Output only the full HTML code in a markdown code block. No extra text outside the block.
