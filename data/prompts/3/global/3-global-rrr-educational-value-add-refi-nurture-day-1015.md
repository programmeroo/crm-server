Create a very clean, mobile-responsive HTML email template (max 600px, tables + inline CSS) for a refinance-only Loan Factory campaign.

Goal: Educate on refinance types (rate/term, cash-out, streamline, remove PMI), position as expert, and encourage a no-pressure call.

Tone: Educational, trustworthy, helpful.  
Personalization: {{FirstName}}

Structure:
- 4 subject line options (value/education: "3 Ways to Save with Refinance", "Is Cash-Out Refi Right for You?")
- One-line preheader
- Body: 140–200 words, bullet points on benefits, quick quiz-style question
- One clear CTA button ("Learn Which Refi Fits You")
- Tiny footer with name, NMLS, unsubscribe

Keep focused on refinance only. Output only the HTML in a code block.
