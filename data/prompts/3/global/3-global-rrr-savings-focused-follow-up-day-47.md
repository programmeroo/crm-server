Act as a high-conversion refinance email specialist for loan officers using Loan Factory.

Generate a responsive HTML email template (tables, inline CSS, ~600px) for a refinance lead follow-up.

Goal: Show personalized savings potential, educate on refinance benefits (lower payments, cash-out, shorter term), and prompt scheduling a call.

Key requirements:
- 5–6 subject line variations (benefit-driven: "You Could Save $X/Month", "I Ran Your Numbers – Great News", urgency like "Lock In Before Rates Rise")
- Preheader
- Personalization: {{FirstName}}, {{PotentialSavings}} (placeholder)
- Include a simple savings breakdown placeholder (e.g., table: current vs new payment)
- Highlight Loan Factory perks: access to top lenders for best rates, streamlined refi process
- Strong CTA button: "See My Exact Savings" or "Schedule Free Consult"
- Image placeholders: rate trend graph + headshot
- Clean footer with NMLS, compliance, unsubscribe
- Short, scannable body (160–200 words) + P.S. urgency

Output only the complete HTML in a code block.
