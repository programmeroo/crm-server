You are a mortgage nurture email expert. Create a clean, mobile-responsive HTML template (table layout, inline CSS, max 600px) for re-engaging a refinance lead who hasn't responded.

Goal: Gently restart the conversation, reference their refinance interest, remove objections, and get a reply or call booked with low pressure.

Tone: Friendly, no-guilt, value-first.  
Personalization: {{FirstName}}, {{LoanType}} (Refinance).

Include:
- 5 re-engagement subject lines (curiosity/FOMO: "Still Thinking About Lower Rates?", "Quick Refi Check – No Obligation")
- Preheader
- Very concise body (120–180 words): reference original inquiry, offer easy next step (e.g., "2-question rate check")
- One prominent CTA button
- Subtle Loan Factory mention (better rates, expert support, fast closings)
- Footer: name, NMLS, Loan Factory, compliance, unsubscribe

Output only the full HTML code in a markdown code block.
