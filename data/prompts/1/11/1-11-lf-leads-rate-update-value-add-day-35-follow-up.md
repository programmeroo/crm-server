Act as a high-conversion email copywriter and HTML designer for mortgage professionals.

Generate a full, responsive HTML email (table-based, inline CSS, ~600px) for a Loan Factory lead follow-up.

Goal: Re-engage the lead with a quick market/rate update and drive them to book a short qualification call.

Key requirements:
- Provide 4–6 subject line variations (curiosity + benefit focused)
- Preheader
- Personalization: {{FirstName}}, {{LoanType}}
- Include a current rates snapshot placeholder (e.g. table or text block)
- Highlight Loan Factory advantages without sounding salesy
- Prominent blue CTA button: "Check My Personalized Rate" or "Book 10-Min Call"
- Small headshot placeholder for the loan officer
- Clean footer with NMLS, compliance, unsubscribe
- P.S. line for extra urgency

Body should be scannable, 150–220 words. Output only the complete HTML in a code block.
