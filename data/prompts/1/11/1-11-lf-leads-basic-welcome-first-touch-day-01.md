You are an expert email template designer for mortgage loan officers. Create a complete, mobile-responsive HTML email template (using tables + inline CSS, max 600px width) for a welcome email to a new Loan Factory lead.

Goal: Welcome the lead, introduce yourself as their assigned Loan Factory loan officer, build instant trust, and get them to reply or book a quick call.

Tone: Warm, professional, confident, helpful.  
Personalization fields: {{FirstName}}, {{LoanType}} (e.g. Purchase, Refinance), {{LoanAmount}}.

Must include:
- 5 strong subject line options
- Preheader text
- Hero image placeholder (600x200)
- 1–2 strong CTAs (e.g. "Schedule a 10-min Call", "Reply to This Email")
- Subtle mention of Loan Factory benefits (competitive rates, 240+ lenders, fast closings, expert support)
- Footer with: your name, NMLS #, Loan Factory mention, unsubscribe link placeholder, basic compliance text

Keep body copy under 200 words. Output only the full HTML code inside a markdown code block. Do not add explanations outside the code block.
