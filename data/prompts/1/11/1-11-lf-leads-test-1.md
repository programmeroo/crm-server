You are an expert email marketing designer and mortgage industry copywriter specializing in high-converting, mobile-responsive HTML email templates for loan officers.

Create a complete, ready-to-use HTML email template for a CRM nurture/follow-up campaign targeting "Loan Factory Leads" — these are warm inbound mortgage leads (purchase or refinance) assigned to loan officers at Loan Factory, a brokerage platform offering 100% commission (minus flat fees), access to 240+ lenders, fast processing, and competitive rates.

The goal of this email is: [specify main goal, e.g., "schedule a quick qualification call", "build trust and educate on current rates", "follow up after initial contact to move toward application", "re-engage stale leads"].

Key elements to include:
- Eye-catching, professional subject line suggestions (provide 4-5 options).
- Preheader text.
- Responsive HTML structure (use inline CSS, tables for layout, max 600-650px width, mobile-friendly with media queries if needed).
- Friendly, trustworthy, confident tone — position the loan officer as a helpful expert partnered with Loan Factory's powerful platform.
- Personalization placeholders like {{FirstName}}, {{LoanAmount}}, {{LoanType}} (e.g., Refinance, Purchase), {{LeadSource}}.
- Highlight Loan Factory benefits subtly: access to top lenders, fast closings, no junk fees, expert processing support, competitive rates, and personalized guidance.
- Strong call-to-action (CTA) buttons (e.g., "Schedule My Free Rate Check", "Apply Now", "Reply to This Email", "Book a 10-Min Call").
- Include a footer with loan officer details, NMLS ID, Loan Factory branding mention, unsubscribe link placeholder, and compliance disclaimers (e.g., "This is not a commitment to lend. Rates subject to change. NMLS #XXXXXX").
- Keep the design clean, modern, minimalistic — use a single accent color like #0066cc (blue) for CTAs.
- Include 1-2 small images placeholders (e.g., hero banner of a house/keys, or Loan Factory logo) with alt text and proper src URLs (use placeholder URLs like https://via.placeholder.com/600x200).
- Add social proof if possible (e.g., "Join thousands of happy homeowners we've helped through Loan Factory").
- End with a P.S. for extra urgency or value.

Output the full HTML code in a code block, followed by a plain-text version of the email body for easy testing.

Make it engaging, concise (aim for 150-300 words), and optimized for high open/click rates in mortgage campaigns.
