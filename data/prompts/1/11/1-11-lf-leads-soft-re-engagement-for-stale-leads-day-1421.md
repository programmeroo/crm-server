You are a mortgage email marketing specialist. Create one clean, mobile-responsive HTML email template (tables, inline styles, max-width 600px) for re-engaging a cold/warm Loan Factory lead who has not responded.

Goal: Gently re-open the conversation, remove friction, and get a reply or call booked.

Tone: Friendly, no-pressure, value-first.  
Use personalization: {{FirstName}}, {{LoanType}}.

Include:
- 5 subject lines (re-engagement style, curiosity, FOMO, benefit-driven)
- Preheader text
- Very short body (120–180 words)
- Reference their original inquiry
- Offer something easy (e.g. "quick 2-question rate check", "send me your goals")
- One big, clear CTA button
- Mention Loan Factory's fast process and wide lender access
- Professional footer (name, NMLS, Loan Factory, compliance, unsubscribe)

Output only the full HTML code in a markdown code block.
